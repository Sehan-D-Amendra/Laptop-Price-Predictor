# Laptop-Price-Predictor

This project aims to predict the prices of laptops based on their specifications using various machine learning techniques. The project is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook and utilizes several popular Python libraries, including Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, and Matplotlib.

### Key Components:

1. **Data Preprocessing:**
    - Utilized Pandas for data cleaning, manipulation, and exploration.
    - Employed NumPy for numerical operations and handling arrays.
2. **Model Development:**
    - Leveraged Scikit-Learn to build and evaluate various machine learning models such as Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests.
    - Applied techniques like train-test split, cross-validation, and hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance.
3. **Visualization:**
    - Used Matplotlib to create visualizations for better understanding of data distributions, feature importance, and model performance.
4. **Web Application:**
    - Developed a simple web application using Flask, which serves as a user interface for the model.
    - Created HTML and CSS files to design the frontend, allowing users to input laptop specifications and get predicted prices.

This project demonstrates the end-to-end process of a machine learning workflow, from data preprocessing and model training to deployment in a web application.
